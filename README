Description of Files

lab1b-client.c
	This source file contains the C code for the client program as described in the spec. The client process connects to the server process using a TCP connection. 

lab1b-server.c 
	This source file contains the C code for the server program as described in the spec. The server process is connected to the client via a TCP connection and to the shell via pipes in both directions.

Both source files implement compression to increase the efficiency of communication over the socket between the server and client.

Makefile
	This file contains the commands needed to build the program and tarball. It contains the client, server, default, clean, and dist targets.

Citations
In both lab1b-server.c and lab1b-client.c, I implemented compression, referencing the code in a Stack Overflow thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540259/deflate-and-inflate-zlib-h-in-c. I also used the zlib(3) manual page https://www.zlib.net/manual.html and zlib tutorial https://www.zlib.net/zlib_how.html in order to further my understanding and implement compression.
